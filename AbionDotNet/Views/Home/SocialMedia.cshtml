        Social Media such as 
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> has become an important part of people's digital lives. Studies show that the average Facebook user spends 20 minutes or more per day using Facebook to communicate with friends, co-workers, and family. Facebook has also become very important for businesses and organizations.
