        ABION can create a new multifunction web application with PHP, or add new features to your already 
        existing PHP application. Normally PHP web applications would work with MySQL Databases on a 
        LAMP stack using Linux operating system, but after MySQL was purchased by Oracle, 
        Michael 'Monty' Widenius, the creator of MySQL, came out with a new open source free database 
        called MariaDB, named after his daughter. 
        ABION has experience with both databases and can readily help you create a 
        new web application, or update an existing web application, hosted on the LAMP stack.
    </p>
    <p>
    The LAMP stack consists of (L) Linux Operating System, (A) Apache Web Server, 
    (M) MySQL or MariaDB database, and (P) PHP Programming Language.
